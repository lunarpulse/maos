# Run MAOS

For operators standing up and running the MAOS kernel.

## Build the kernel

```bash
cargo build -p maos-bin --release
```

## Start the daemon

```bash
./target/release/maos init    # first-time setup (creates $MAOS_HOME)
./target/release/maos run     # start the kernel daemon
```

`maos init` is also the one writer of the operator door's `control.json`:
it records the loopback endpoint and bearer token the mutating verbs
authenticate with. Rotation is `rm $MAOS_HOME/control.json && maos init`.

### The evaluator shell

```bash
./target/release/maos shell
```

The shell loads the reference Spirit (`hello-spirit`) into the scheduler
under a real pid, then renders a REPL. Directives are typed as
`@hello-spirit <message>`; `Ctrl-D` exits. A deliberately ambiguous
directive — for example `@hello-spirit refactor src/main.rs to be more
idiomatic` — halts the Spirit on `task.acceptance_criterion.ambiguous`:

```
[HALT task.acceptance_criterion.ambiguous] 'more idiomatic' is undefined; …
halt 01M2GJ3GJMJRBB7PWQXPKWJT3K — type a clarification, or:
  maosctl halt resolve 01M2GJ3GJMJRBB7PWQXPKWJT3K --spirit hello-spirit \
    --kind provided-context --text "…"
```

Resolve it on **either surface** — type the clarification directly into the
REPL, or from a second terminal:

```bash
maosctl halt list --spirit hello-spirit          # shows the halt_id
maosctl halt resolve <halt_id> --spirit hello-spirit \
  --kind provided-context --text "idiomatic = clippy-clean, no unwrap"
```

Both surfaces share one mechanism (the operator door): the REPL renders the
resolution the moment the registry flips, and the Spirit **proceeds with
your clarification**. `maos audit query --spirit hello-spirit` then shows
the halt row and the `operator.halt-resolve` completion row — including
whether it completed.

### Inference mode (ADR-064)

The kernel's inference can run from a cassette (hermetic), record into one,
or call a live provider:

```bash
MAOS_INFERENCE_MODE=replay MAOS_REPLAY_CASSETTE=<cassette.json> maos shell
MAOS_INFERENCE_MODE=record MAOS_REPLAY_CASSETTE=<out.json> maos shell
MAOS_INFERENCE_MODE=live    maos shell
```

### Provider keys (today)

Live inference resolves `MAOS_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `MAOS_OPENAI_API_KEY`
through the OS keyring by default. If the bounded keyring attempt is unavailable
or the named entry is absent, MAOS falls back to the composition-root-captured
environment value and records a `secret.source.fallback` audit event without key
material. Set `MAOS_SECRETS_BACKEND=env` for headless CI, or
`MAOS_SECRETS_BACKEND=encrypted-file` with `MAOS_KMS_MASTER_KEY` for the sealed
file vault. Keys are resolved when providers are constructed; just-in-time
materialization and bounded in-memory lifetime remain open.

When the keyring is healthy and the named entry is absent, MAOS promotes the
captured environment credential into the keyring at boot, and later boots
resolve from the keyring; the promotion is journaled without key material. A
later `maos purge` removes keyring entries under MAOS's namespace, including
entries created by this promotion.

The keyring is safer for secrets at rest and keeps them out of process
environment listings. It does not protect a key from another process running as
your user on the same host.

### Remove MAOS state

`maos purge` is a dry run unless `--yes` is present. It names each MAOS-owned
root and credential before removal, leaves operator-authored signing and
configuration files intact, refuses while a live daemon or offline durable
operation holds a store, and writes a JSON receipt outside the deleted roots.
After a successful purge, remove the Cargo-owned binary with
`cargo uninstall maos`.

`maos purge --keep-log --yes` checkpoints and keeps the Transparency Log. This
also keeps shared-memory rows and the principal namespace index when they share
that database, including capability-token rows and legacy `shell.turn` text.
The dry run reports those retained categories with counts before deletion.
When tenant mode is active the whole `teams/` subtree is retained — not only
the resolved team's log — and the dry run and receipt name every sibling team
log with its row counts. This retention is an operator-chosen, documented
exception to FR2's clean-uninstall guarantee; deletion is the default.

## Operate

The kernel composition root lives in `crates/maos-bin`. Operational surfaces — the transparency log, capability mediation, sandbox tiers, ComplianceClaim admission, the registry, and yank propagation — are documented in the reference guides:

- [Deployment Topology](/deploy/) — air-gap, backup/restore, release signing
- [Troubleshooting](/troubleshoot/) — every error code with cause and remediation
- [ABI Stability](https://github.com/lunarpulse/maos/blob/main/STABILITY.md) — the v1.0 ABI compatibility matrix

## Air-gapped install

For network-isolated environments, see the [Air-Gap Deployment Runbook](/deploy/air-gap-deployment) and the `maosctl install --source` offline import path.
