# Run MAOS

For operators standing up and running the MAOS kernel.

## Build the kernel

```bash
cargo build -p maos-bin --release
```

## Start the daemon

```bash
./target/release/maos init    # first-time setup (creates $MAOS_HOME)
./target/release/maos run     # start the kernel daemon
```

## Operate

The kernel composition root lives in `crates/maos-bin`. Operational surfaces — the transparency log, capability mediation, sandbox tiers, ComplianceClaim admission, the registry, and yank propagation — are documented in the reference guides:

- [Deployment Topology](/deploy/) — air-gap, backup/restore, release signing
- [Troubleshooting](/troubleshoot/) — every error code with cause and remediation
- [ABI Stability](https://github.com/lunarpulse/maos/blob/main/STABILITY.md) — the v1.0 ABI compatibility matrix

## Air-gapped install

For network-isolated environments, see the [Air-Gap Deployment Runbook](/deploy/air-gap-deployment) and the `maosctl install --source` offline import path.
