# Run MAOS

For operators standing up and running the MAOS kernel.

## Build the kernel

```bash
cargo build -p maos-bin --release
```

## Start the daemon

```bash
./target/release/maos init    # first-time setup (creates $MAOS_HOME)
./target/release/maos run     # start the kernel daemon
```

`maos init` is also the one writer of the operator door's `control.json`:
it records the loopback endpoint and bearer token the mutating verbs
authenticate with. Rotation is `rm $MAOS_HOME/control.json && maos init`.

### The evaluator shell

```bash
./target/release/maos shell
```

The shell loads the reference Spirit (`hello-spirit`) into the scheduler
under a real pid, then renders a REPL. Directives are typed as
`@hello-spirit <message>`; `Ctrl-D` exits. A deliberately ambiguous
directive — for example `@hello-spirit refactor src/main.rs to be more
idiomatic` — halts the Spirit on `task.acceptance_criterion.ambiguous`:

```
[HALT task.acceptance_criterion.ambiguous] 'more idiomatic' is undefined; …
halt 01M2GJ3GJMJRBB7PWQXPKWJT3K — type a clarification, or:
  maosctl halt resolve 01M2GJ3GJMJRBB7PWQXPKWJT3K --spirit hello-spirit \
    --kind provided-context --text "…"
```

Resolve it on **either surface** — type the clarification directly into the
REPL, or from a second terminal:

```bash
maosctl halt list --spirit hello-spirit          # shows the halt_id
maosctl halt resolve <halt_id> --spirit hello-spirit \
  --kind provided-context --text "idiomatic = clippy-clean, no unwrap"
```

Both surfaces share one mechanism (the operator door): the REPL renders the
resolution the moment the registry flips, and the Spirit **proceeds with
your clarification**. `maos audit query --spirit hello-spirit` then shows
the halt row and the `operator.halt-resolve` completion row — including
whether it completed.

### Inference mode (ADR-064)

The kernel's inference can run from a cassette (hermetic), record into one,
or call a live provider:

```bash
MAOS_INFERENCE_MODE=replay MAOS_REPLAY_CASSETTE=<cassette.json> maos shell
MAOS_INFERENCE_MODE=record MAOS_REPLAY_CASSETTE=<out.json> maos shell
MAOS_INFERENCE_MODE=live    maos shell
```

### Provider keys (today)

Live inference reads the provider key from the environment:
`MAOS_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `MAOS_OPENAI_API_KEY`. OS-keyring storage is
planned (Story 16-4); until then the env vars are the only source.

## Operate

The kernel composition root lives in `crates/maos-bin`. Operational surfaces — the transparency log, capability mediation, sandbox tiers, ComplianceClaim admission, the registry, and yank propagation — are documented in the reference guides:

- [Deployment Topology](/deploy/) — air-gap, backup/restore, release signing
- [Troubleshooting](/troubleshoot/) — every error code with cause and remediation
- [ABI Stability](https://github.com/lunarpulse/maos/blob/main/STABILITY.md) — the v1.0 ABI compatibility matrix

## Air-gapped install

For network-isolated environments, see the [Air-Gap Deployment Runbook](/deploy/air-gap-deployment) and the `maosctl install --source` offline import path.
